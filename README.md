# R_three_armed_trial_power_project

A code that I wrote to calculate power and a provisional statistical analysis plan for a three armed clinical trial.

Supporting documents include documentation for the `ThreeArmedTrials` package in R and useful guidelines for choosing margins.

The dataset provided is a simulated dataset and does NOT contain real patient data.
